# ARt

In today's era, most of the exhibitions and works of art are presented to the public in the same method that has been used from the beginning of time. In today's technological age there is a desire to combine the old world of art with the new world of technology and create a new type of art that is based on augmented reality.
AR let us see the real-life environment right in front of us with a digital augmentation overlaid on it. For example, the game Pokémon GO  or instagram filters.

The purpose of this project is to develop an application that the user can use as a unifying factor between the reality (artist’s drawing) and the augmented reality (animation on it). We want to create new dimensions of art by linking classical with digital art.
